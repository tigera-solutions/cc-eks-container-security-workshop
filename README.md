# AWS Dev Days: Hands-on workshop: <br> Implementing container security on EKS

## Welcome

The intent of this workshop is to educate security and technical teams working with Kubernetes platform how to secure cloud-native applications deployed onto the platform using Calico Cloud. While there are many capabilities available in Calico Cloud, this workshop focuses on a subset of specific security features used often by security teams and other types of technical users.

## Time Requeriments

The estimated time to complete this workshop is 90-120 minutes.

## Target Audience

- Cloud Professionals
- DevSecOps Professional
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
- Solutions Architects
- Anyone interested in Calico Cloud :)

## Learning Objectives

Learn how to:
- Scan container images and block deployment based on your security criteria during build time.
- Preview and enforce security policies to protect vulnerable workloads.
- Implement zero-trust access controls to prevent egress and lateral movement during runtime.
- Implement runtime security with IDS/IPS, WAF, and malware detection.
- Get visibility into Kubernetes cluster traffic to troubleshoot and improve security.

## Modules

This workshop is organized in sequencial modules. One module will build up on top of the previous module, so please, follow the order as proposed below.

Module 1 - Prerequisites  
Module 2 - Getting Started  
Module 3 - Deploy an AWS EKS cluster using Calico CNI  
Module 4 - Connect the AWS EKS cluster to Calico Cloud  
Module 5 - Create the test environment  
Module 6 - Enable egress gateway support  
Module 7 - Deploy Egress Gateway for a per pod selection  
Module 8 - Deploy Egress Gateway for a per namespace selector  
Module 9 - Deploy Egress Gateway with an AWS elastic IP  
Module 10 - Clean up  

> **Note:** The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how Calico Cloud can be configured to build a functional solution. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.
