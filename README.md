# AWS Dev Days: Hands-on workshop: <br>Implementing container security on EKS

Hands-on EKS-focused security workshop with AWS Dev Days and Calico experts to learn how to prevent, detect, and stop breaches in applications running on EKS. The 90-minute interactive lab comes with your own provisioned Calico Cloud environment and a sample application. You will leave this workshop with hands-on experience on how to:

- Scan container images and block deployment based on your security criteria during build time
- Preview and enforce security policies to protect vulnerable workloads
- Implement zero-trust access controls to prevent egress and lateral movement during runtime
- Implement runtime security with IDS/IPS, WAF, and malware detection 
- Get visibility into Kubernetes cluster traffic to troubleshoot and improve security

We have limited the number of participants for this workshop to ensure that each participant can receive adequate attention.
